- ✅ Check you have enough tBRZ balance
- ✅ Verify gas fees (need ~0.000005 SOL)
- ✅ Wait up to 10 seconds for confirmation
- 🔍 Check transaction on [Solana Explorer (Devnet)](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet)

### Wallet won't connect
- ✅ Refresh the page

- ✅ Ensure Phantom is on Devnet network
- ✅ Try disconnecting and reconnecting

### tBRZ doesn't show in wallet
